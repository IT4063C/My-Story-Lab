# My-Story-Lab
Using `pyenv` & `virtualenv`, I set up a virtual env named `it4063c-3-10-4`.
It's advisable that you create a new virtual env. for every assignment you work on to avoid dependency conflicts.

to get started on this project, in your virtual env. install the project dependencies
using 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to run the automated tests 
```bash 
pytest --capture=sys
```
